# Implementation of a Hangman Game!
## Overview of the Hangman program's functionality

This is an easy-to-use Hangman game I made from scratch as apart of a class project. This Hangman program is modelled after Tech With Mike 's Hangman coding tutorial.
Mr. Michael's tutorial helped me tremendously with this project and I was even able to implement my own code in it as well.

I'd like to thank Professor Praveen for allowing us to use outside help & I'd like to thank the TA's for their assistance.

As stated previously, this hangman project is a **easy-to-use** Hangman game which selects from a list of encoded words randomly and **decodes** them
to reveal a hidden word if played properly.


### Running the code

As you run the program, it will welcome you with a nice introduction. 
You will need to enter your name
and type the number "1" to start the game.

You start off with 10 "lives" or attempts and the goal is to guess one of the words the program selected successfully
in order for you to win and find out the word's decoded translation!

With every incorrect guess, you will lose one life. If you get all the way down to 0 lives, its game over. You lose and you can restart the game
if you want to continue playing!

If you win however, with any number of lives or "attempts" over 0, the encrypted word will be decrypted or "decoded" and you will recieve the proper, secret word.

Guessing a letter you've already chose before will not subtract a life or "attempt" off from you, however you will be continuously  reminded of the letter
you've already selected.

Thank you for choosing to play or build upon my Hangman project, as as stated, thank you Tech With Mike (Mr. Michael) for such a wonderful python tutorial.
